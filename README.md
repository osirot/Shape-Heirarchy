# Shape-Heirarchy
demonstrates inheritance in java


This project was built to demonstrate and build skills in inheritance, as well as continue my skills in
receiving a base file from another programmer and to read their code and build upon it. 

MyShape file is the superclass of all the shapes. The triangle, square, rectangle, eclipse and circle all inherit from the parent class MyShape. 

The TestShapes.java file can be run in a Java IDE of your choice, after all class files are downloaded. TestShapes runs a small simple program that allows a user to pick a shape, give a few demensions and in return the program executes calculations for perimeter and area.
